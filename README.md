# PyNet
A very simplistic neural network library written in Python with NumPy. Included is also a trivial example application, xor.py, which approximates the XOR function. Both the library and the example application are based on a version written by Daniel Shiffman in p5.js as part of his "The Nature of Code" series, on his YouTube channel "The Coding Train".  

# User Guide
If Python 3 is installed, you can run xor.py to test the example application. You can also ``import pynet`` in your own projects.

# v1.0 Changelog
 - Added pynet.py!
 - Added the xor.py example.

# What Did I Learn?
 - How a neural network works, and how it is set up in code.
 - How linear algebra (matrix maths!) can be applied to neural networks.
 - How to efficiently implement the necessary operations with NumPy.
